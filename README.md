This was a project created by Ismael Suring in High School for the AP Computer Science Pricipals create task. 
It consists of a platformer where the protagonist is a duck who really loves mushrooms and must navigate the level to get to them.
Most of the pixle art and some of the code was found else where.

The DaFluffyPotato Tutorial on how to make a platoformer in Pygame really helped me figure out how everything worked and I am 
using a large quantity of the code that was provided with this video:

Another tutorial that was used was DaFluffyPotato paticle tutorial for pygame

There are 2 runnable functions of the program:
One of them is the game.py in which you get to play the game and use all the functionality of the player and platforming
The other is the editor.py in which you can make or edit existing levels and save them into a json file called map.json

All of the player input can be found in the file scripts/event_handler.py
